                <h3>Is EduChain a private blockchain, owned by GCIT?</h3>
                <p>No, the EduChain Ledger is a decentralized, public blockchain. Any changes that would impact
                    transaction processing or consensus need to be approved by at least 80% of the network. GCIT is a
                    contributor to the network, but its rights are
                    the same as those of other contributors. In terms of validation, there are 150+ validators on the
                    network with 35+ on the default Unique Node List.
                    GCIT runs only_1 of these nodes.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Isn't Proof of Work the best validation mechanism?</h3>
                <p>Proof of Work (PoW) was the first mechanism to solve the double spend problem without requiring a
                    trusted 3rd party. The EduChain Ledger’s
                    consensus mechanism solves the same problem in a far faster, cheaper and more energy efficient way.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What happens if more than 20% of nodes within the network do not agree with the majority? How is the
                    final version of the ledger chosen?</h3>
                <p>Normally, if there is a dispute about the validity of one transaction, that transaction gets pushed
                    back until the majority can come to an agreement. But if more than 20% of the network did not follow
                    the same protocol rules as the majority, the network would temporarily halt. It could resume when
                    participants reconfigure their UNLs based on those who want to reach consensus with each other. This
                    temporary processing delay is desired rather than double spending.

                    In the process of determining the authoritative version of a ledger, there may be multiple temporary
                    internal versions. Such internal versions naturally happen in distributed systems because not all
                    nodes receive transactions in the same order. The analogous behavior in Bitcoin is where two servers
                    each see a different longest chain because two blocks were mined at about the same time.
                    However, there can be only one latest validated ledger version at any given time; other versions are
                    irrelevant and harmless.</p>

                <h3>Can financial institutions set up transaction validators to help them meet specific institutional
                    standards and requirements?</h3>
                <p>No, institutions cannot set up customized validator policies for choosing to allow some transactions
                    and reject others. Validators either follow the protocol, or they do not. If software does not
                    follow protocol rules, it does not function. Thus, it is not recommended that institutions seek out
                    custom implementations without in-house expertise.</p>
